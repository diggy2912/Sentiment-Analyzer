These subsidies significantly lower the cost of fossil fuel production and consumption, often masking the true economic and environmental costs."

2024-08-14 15:58:00+00:00,This is not the right metric to judge the growth. You cannot imagine the amount of fake eway bills are generated just to set off GST. In Gujarat bhavnagar is very famous for this and most ship breakers are under scrutiny (do a google search about gst notices with bhavnagar)  Any city which is nearest to a port is the biggest source of doing the business of bills (Just invoices) and a new parallel economy (black money) via angadia system starts.   Govt if started giving GST returns filling per category one would understand were is the growth coming from & how is the growth.   Running a marketplace like pneucons.com allows me to be directly in touch with smes & msmes and the ground reality is demand is very much fluctuating since the FY started in engineering sectors. Last 2 months there's no flow of money and demand is reduced.   I had a word with my CA who has more than 750+ companies and when i asked the performance of GSTR-1 he said it has reduced month on month since may-24.

2024-08-15 05:27:00+00:00,"The selection process for implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) within an organization for specific use cases involves several critical steps, each designed to ensure that the chosen LLM aligns with organizational goals, operational needs, and budget constraints.   Here's a detailed guide based on the latest insights and practices:  1.  Define Your Use Case and Requirements:     -  Start by defining the problem or task the LLM is meant to solve or enhance.   This could range from customer support, content generation, data analysis, to internal knowledge management.  Understanding the specific needs helps in narrowing down the type of LLM required.  2.  Identify Key Capabilities Needed:     -  Determine if you need capabilities like natural language understanding, generation, translation, or specific domain knowledge (e.g., legal, medical).   Consider whether the model needs to be fine-tuned for your industry or if general-purpose capabilities suffice.  3.  Shortlist LLMs Based on Requirements:     -  Model Size and Performance:  Larger models might offer better performance but at higher computational costs.   Consider if your task requires the depth of understanding provided by models like Cohere, GPT-4, Gemani or if a smaller, more specialized model like BERT for sentiment analysis would do.     -  Training Data:   Look for models trained on datasets relevant to your use case.   For instance, if dealing with medical texts, a model with medical training would be preferable.     -  Cost: Evaluate the cost implications, considering not just the direct costs (like API fees) but also infrastructure for deployment, maintenance, and potential fine-tuning.  4.  Evaluate on Specific Criteria:     -  Performance:   Test shortlisted models with your data or similar datasets to see how they perform in terms of accuracy, latency, and relevance.     -  Integration: Check how easily the LLM can be integrated with your existing systems.   This includes API availability, compatibility with your tech stack, and security considerations.     -  Scalability and Maintenance:  Consider future scalability. Will the model's performance degrade with increased load?   What are the ongoing maintenance requirements?  5.  Prototyping and Testing:     -  Before full-scale deployment, prototype with the most promising candidates.   This phase should involve real-world testing, possibly in a controlled environment, to see how the model interacts with actual data and user queries.  6.  Selection and Deployment:     -  After testing, choose the LLM that best balances performance, cost, and integration ease.   Plan the deployment, considering factors like data privacy, especially if dealing with sensitive information.  7.  Fine-Tuning, Monitoring, and Maintenance:     -  Post-deployment, fine-tuning might be necessary to adapt the LLM to your specific needs or to improve performance based on feedback.   Establish processes for continuous monitoring for biases, performance degradation, or updates in model capabilities.  8.  Stay Informed:     -  The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving.   Regularly review new models, updates, and trends in AI, like the shift towards more efficient models or the integration of LLMs with other AI technologies for enhanced capabilities.  This process ensures that the organization leverages the power of LLMs efficiently, tailored to its unique needs, thereby enhancing productivity, reducing costs, or improving customer interaction, among other benefits.   Remember, the choice of an LLM should be strategic, aligning with both immediate needs and long-term organizational goals."

2024-08-15 06:47:00+00:00,"1. **Federalism and Autonomy**: There's a growing tension regarding federalism, where states like Tamil Nadu argue for more autonomy. This includes issues over taxation, borrowing limits, and the implementation of central policies like GST, NEET, and the National Education Policy (NEP) without adequate consultation with state governments. The central government's approach to these matters has been seen by some in Tamil Nadu as undermining state rights, leading to conflicts over how resources are allocated and how policies are implemented.  2. **Cultural and Political Identity**: Tamil Nadu has a strong regional identity, often expressed through language, culture, and political movements that emphasize Dravidian identity over a broader Indian nationalism. This has sometimes led to conflicts with central policies perceived as promoting a more uniform national identity, like the push for Hindi or certain cultural practices, which are seen as encroaching on Tamil culture.  3. **Economic Policies and Resource Allocation**: There's a sentiment that Tamil Nadu contributes significantly more to the central pool than it receives back in terms of central transfers. This disparity in economic treatment, where states like Tamil Nadu argue they are taxed more but receive less in return, fuels resentment. The central government's economic policies, including how funds are distributed, have been criticized for not adequately considering the contributions of prosperous states like Tamil Nadu.  4. **Political Confrontations**: Incidents like the withdrawal of general consent to the CBI by the Tamil Nadu government, or the refusal to play the national anthem in the state assembly, have been interpreted as symbolic acts of defiance against central authority. These actions, along with the central government's reactions, contribute to the narrative of an adversarial relationship.  5. **Governance and Policy Implementation**: The central government's decisions on various issues, from education (NEET) to taxation (GST), have been implemented in ways that Tamil Nadu's government has found restrictive or contrary to state interests. This includes the central government's stance on state bills, like those related to education, which have been delayed or returned by the Governor, seen as an extension of central control.  The situation is complex, involving economic, cultural, and political dimensions. While there's clear friction, much of it stems from differing visions of federalism, economic policies, and cultural identity, rather than a straightforward antagonism. However, these issues are often framed in a binary opposition in public discourse, which might not fully capture the nuanced interactions between state and central governance in India."

2024-08-15 11:39:00+00:00,"Prior to the budget in July 2024, there were a few challenges to invest in Global Equities. However, several announcements during the budget session and RBI's decision about Resident Indians opening a 'Foreign Currency Account' has made it easier for Indians to invest Globally. With such moves aimed at facilitating international transactions, investing internationally has become more accessible.  During the course of this #MarcellusWebinar, our Global Compounders Fund Management team have discussed:  a. How investing Globally has become easier b. The advantages that a Resident Indian now benefits from c. The importance and advantages of diversification especially with the Indian and US Equity markets having a low correlation d. How a 50:50 Indian and American portfolio could have generated a higher return over a 20-Year period and more.  With GCP also outperforming the benchmark since inception by ~8%, we also answer the much-asked question on how the Portfolio is placed going forward.

Let's assume gold price has appreciated by 10% in a year and investor sells - on all digital gold platforms the sell price is 2-3% lower than buy price. So the user gets back Rs.522 net.   Instead of getting 550-500 = Rs.50, the user gets Rs.22 profit and lost Rs.28 in charges.   Take the same example with Gold MF where the TER is 0.5% & GST is zero. So for the same 10% growth net of TER the invested value appreciates to Rs.547.5 and hence Rs.47.5 profit.  Which product is right for the investor?"

2024-08-16 00:52:00+00:00,"Why is the US not winning the Drone War with China despite all the sanctions and tech blockade on China's drone industry and massive subsidies for local manufacturing.  US-made drones are significantly more expensive and less capable than their Chinese counterparts, which poses challenges for their adoption and competitiveness:  1. US drones are priced three to four times higher than Chinese models, despite not offering superior technology[4].  2. Many commercial UAVs from the US cost tens of thousands of dollars more than comparable Chinese drones, which is a no-no for industries such as big scale commercial farming where drones are used at scale[5].  3. The high costs of US drones make them less feasible for budget-constrained users like Ukraine's military, commercial videographers, or even YouTube content creators [5].  Key factors contributing to the higher costs of US drones include:  - Labor costs - Lack of skilled labour  - Smaller production scale - Expensive custom chipsets - Stringent US Defense Department requirements - Prohibition on using Chinese components[4][5]  In contrast, Chinese drones, particularly those made by DJI, are very high quality as proven by the Ukraine War [5], much more affordable, easily repaired or replaced; and dominate the market:  - DJI alone controls about 70-80% of the global commercial and US drone markets[4]. - Chinese drones remain popular among  US law enforcement agencies, forestry departments and survey and inspection departments of various arms of government due to their lower costs and high functionality and reliability [4]. - Even US allies are dependent on Chinese drones and components as they are the only supplier for many key components such as rotors, controllers, sensors, batteries, etc.  The significant price disparity makes it challenging for US manufacturers to compete, especially against Chinese companies[4]. This cost difference is a major factor driving the continued popularity and widespread use of Chinese-made drones, even in sensitive sectors.

But this announcement is far from reality and banking practices.   Majority of banks are only prefering to extend credit line to A rated customer and for BBB rating they have certain biased and prejudice, which is ultimately defeating the whole purpose TReDS and Vendor finance. In India majority of corporates turnover lies between 250 cr to 1000 cr. And these are the company falls under emerging corporate . Due to various credit rating parameters they are mostly falls under BBB- and BBB+ . So finance ministory particularly department of financial services (DFS) and Nirmala Sitharaman  Vivek Joshi  should come out with some guidelines else objectives of providing liquidity to MSME will be defeated.

Tax rebate is available under PLI but to encourage more small entrepreneurs to start new venture and create jobs. this model was followed by China and still in practice  2. Remove Red Tapism. Despite various claims, we still do not have ease of doing business and corruption stares at every stage of setting up  3. Slikk training on a very large level and the same be taken as a graduation degree if taken up after 12th. This will encourage many youth to join skill development and we shall have youg hands.

2024-08-16 14:17:00+00:00,"*Believe it or not*‚Äîthe government has once again proven its knack for making education a luxury by taxing research! IIT Delhi, a premier institute known for contributing to India's intellectual capital, has received a hefty ‚Çπ120 crore GST bill for research funding from 2017 to 2022. And who do we have to thank for this academic heist? None other than the finance ministry led by our dear Nirmala Sitharaman.  Remember when the same FM once stood on a podium and declared that she wished she could bring down taxes to nil.  Well, surprise! It seems that promise was as flimsy as a politician's campaign slogan.   After all, why invest in the nation's brainpower when you can squeeze every last penny out of it? It's almost poetic‚Äîcripple the universities with high tuition fees, then slap them with a GST bill for daring to conduct research.  But the madness doesn't stop there. In the recent budget, the import tax on chemicals used in higher secondary labs was increased, making sure even basic science education feels the pinch.   So, let's get this straight: research and education are prime targets for revenue, but what about cracking down on money laundering, tax evasion, and the loopholes that the rich and powerful so gleefully exploit?   Oh no, that would require real effort from the revenue department, wouldn't it?  It's funny how the government always manages to tax the common man, the students, and the educational institutions trying to better this country while letting the big fish swim free.   So, hats off to the FM and her team‚Äîthis is peak governance! Because nothing screams ""nation-building"" like taxing the very foundation of knowledge and innovation.  #education @nsitharaman @FinMinIndia @EduMinOfIndia"

Taxing research, which is the backbone of innovation and technological advancement, reveals this government's complete disregard for the future of India's academic and research institutions. Instead of empowering institutions like IIT Delhi to excel in research, they are burdening them with punitive taxes.  On the other hand, the same Modi government conveniently exempts Patanjali's research from taxes for five years, from 2022 to 2027. The hypocrisy is blatant. When it comes to aiding corporate allies and their dubious ventures, the government is quick to roll out tax exemptions. But when it comes to institutions driving the nation's scientific and technological development, the same government isn't hesitant to cripple them with hefty taxes.  This is not governance for the people‚Äîthis is governance for political cronies. By taxing research while exempting corporate entities like Patanjali, the Modi government is sending a clear message: corporate interests come first, and the nation's intellectual future comes last."

2024-08-17 05:02:00+00:00,"One frequently asked question I get is how to divide budget between search and display on Amazon  Where there is no one size fit all answer to this, here is what I usually follow  a) When you start, allocate almost 100% to search. Find keywords which are highly relevant to your product. While they are still generic, they are also specific enough to what you are selling. Eg: ""ceiling fan"" is a generic keyword, but""remote controlled ceiling fan"" is a specific generic keyword. In the beginning, allocate almost 100% budget to these specific generic keywords. Once you exhaust, start testing the pure generic keywords  b) Once you reach a certain scale with search, start experimenting with display. But do targeted display. You can target your brand viewers, category viewers etc. Display usually have a much lower CPC, but also poorer conversions. So take calls basis the CPC*Conversion rate metric.  So if your search CPC is Rs 20 and conversion of x and your display CPC is Rs 5 and conversion is x/3, you are better off increasing spends on display  c) Once you are amongst the top 3-4 players in the category, your search and display split has to mimic the consumer behavior in the category. And Amazon Pi gives you all the details here. Go to Audience Planning Insights. Check the audience size in the selected subcategory( Level 2). You can get the size for both searchers( people who arrive at a product by searching) and browsers( People who browse through category banners and filters to arrive at product). If there are 2M searchers and 1 M browsers, then your search to display ratio also should be 2:1 unless of course you see a drastic difference in your CPC and conversion rates between Search and Display  Once the broad allocation is done, then you can keep optimizing and making changes dynamically.   Sometimes CPCs in search gets crazy high due to irrational spending and bidding. In those months, better to increase allocation in display to maintain overall ACOS"

My take : #Invest in NPS if you are in taxable slab. ùó™ùóµùòÜ: Consider you are in 30% tax slab and your income is 20lacs. If you invest 1lac in NPS you are saving 30k tax. Now see the magic. Your investment value 1lac on day 1 with 70k investment(if you remove the tax savings). And additionally you will get returns on these investments, on conservative case also you will get 8%.  Few #important things are here to consider 1. Long waiting period to enjoy the benefits. 2. Don't invest over amounts in NPS. Only invest amount which are satisfying the limits for tax saving. a. In Old tax regime you can invest upto 2lacs(1.5lac 80c and 50k 80CCD) and 10% of your basic pay if you are eligible for corporate NPS account. b. In new tax regime you can invest upto 10%(Increased to 14% in recent budget) of your basic salary.  Only invest in NPS if you can hold on till that much long periods, consider it like another PF only.  I'm not a registered advisor, its just my opinion.  #investing #stockmarket #tiwk"

Out of that they may have to pay tax too  Exchanges are getting 40% of the charges but they may have to pay GST and Tax on profit too  Govt directly gets over 36% of the total charges. On top of that they get Income tax/Capital Gain tax from the profitable traders/institutions, Tax on profit from exchanges and brokers, etc. So it is undoubtably Government. Revised charges this year is much higher too  What trainers earn must be lower than all these  Investors make good money but I don't know how much overall  Net to Net traders don't earn anything as it is a negative sum game. What the winners get is far lower than what the losers lose. So no net gain for traders overall."

2024-08-18 08:08:00+00:00,"Nothing new about this. Since even before VONC PTI has been actively conducting economic sabotage against Pakistan. Announcement of ruinous subsidies was undertaken in Feb 2022 by IK, which resulted in a reduction of our foreign reserves by almost 50%. Subsequently, PTI wrote those infamous letters to IMF, first in July 2022 through KP Finance Minister Mr. Taimour Jhagra, then in Jan/ Feb 23.  While Federal govt was making commitments to IMF to curb expenditure through 2022/23, PTI led provincial governments in Punjab & KP were deliberately undertaking massive expenditure in order to ensure massive deficits & increased public borrowing. One should be grateful to whoever advised IK to dissolve these govts as only after their departure did Pakistan start on the painful road to economic recovery. Throughout the process PTI has sought to discourage IMF engaging with Pakistan & actively worked to sabotage bilateral economic relations.   PPP lost ZAB to the gallows & BB to an assassins bullet, while PMLN has had NS / leadership ousted numerous times, incarcerated & thrown into exile, yet never have the two parties ever sought to harm Pakistan through economic sabotage (or through militancy). It's blatantly obvious that PTI feels that it owes no loyalty to this country, rather their only objective is self aggrandisement, with IK the convenient excuse to gloss over their crimes."

2024-08-18 11:35:00+00:00,"Peter Schiff Has A Warning On Fed Cutting Interest Rate: Federal Budget Deficits And Weaker Dollar Will Fuel Higher Inflation  Prominent economist and vocal Bitcoin BTC/USD critic Peter Schiff cautioned that a combination of lower interest rates and a recession could lead to a surge in inflation. This, he believes, could be triggered by increased federal deficits and a weaker dollar.  What Happened: On Tuesday, Schiff took to X to express his concerns about the potential consequences of a recession and lower interest rates.  He stated, ""The irony is that investors believe lower #inflation and a #recession will allow the #Fed to cut interest rates. However, the effect of lower interest rates and a recession will be larger federal budget deficits and a weaker dollar, both of which will lead to higher inflation.""  Why It Matters: Schiff's warning comes at a time when the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is under intense scrutiny. The July Consumer Price Index inflation report, scheduled for release on Wednesday, could significantly influence investor expectations ahead of the Fed's September meeting.  Depending on the inflation data, markets may gain clarity on whether to expect a modest or substantial interest rate cut next month. If inflation slows more than anticipated, it would reinforce the view that inflation is nearing the Fed's 2% target, potentially pushing traders to bet on a larger rate cut by 50 basis points in September.  Conversely, if inflation meets or exceeds expectations, it could signal a setback in the disinflationary trend, increasing the likelihood of a more modest 0.25% rate cut.  Additionally, the Producer Price Index for July showed a decline following an unexpected rise in June, much to the relief of the markets. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, noted that the lower-than-expected PPI data is good news for those worried about the Fed being cautious in lowering interest rates due to lingering inflation. Traders are now looking to retail sales for signals on consumer spending as they anticipate the release of July's CPI.  Moreover, Mohamed El-Erian, Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, criticized the Federal Reserve for not reducing interest rates in July and warned that the market's anticipation of a 200 basis point cut in the next year is excessive. El-Erian voiced his concerns about the lack of clarity regarding future rate cuts, adding to the market uncertainty.  Jason Furman, former Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, dismissed fears of an imminent U.S. recession but urged the Federal Reserve to act decisively if unemployment rises. Furman emphasized that emergency rate cuts are not required at the moment, suggesting that inflation is only slightly above where it should be."

WRIT PETITION No.648 of 2024  Facts of the Case ‚ñ™The case revolved around Standard Chartered Bank, which is registered in Maharashtra, encountering a technical glitch on the Maharashtra GST portal while attempting to file its returns. ‚ñ™Due to the technical issue, the Bank filed its returns on the GST portal of Telangana, where one of its branches exists. The Bank subsequently took credit through TRAN-01 and transferred it to the Maharashtra portal on the same day. ‚ñ™The Additional Commissioner of Customs and Central Tax assumed that the Bank could not have filed its return on the Telangana portal, leading to a Show Cause Notice (SCN) and an order disallowing the carry forward credit of eligible duties.  Court Judgement ‚ñ™ Observations: The Telangana High Court found that there was no legal prohibition under Section 140 of the CGST Act that prevented the Bank from filing its return on the Telangana GST portal, where it had a branch. ‚ñ™The Court highlighted that the credit was transferred to the Maharashtra portal on the same day with the same PAN, and the Department cannot penalize the Bank due to the technical glitch on the Maharashtra portal. ‚ñ™ Judgment: The Court quashed the SCN and the order disallowing the carry forward of credit, ruling in favour of the Bank. The Court held that the Department's actions were ""bad in law"" and that the Bank's actions were within legal bounds given the circumstances. The writ petition filed by the Bank¬†was¬†allowed."

Since 2015, SGBs have raised Rs 72,275 crore by mobilizing 147 tonnes of gold, with nearly 11% annual returns and 2.5-2.75% taxable interest.  4. The government paid over 11% on eight-year SGBs but can now borrow at under 7%. Rising gold prices make SGBs a costly borrowing option.  5. SGBs offer capital gains tax exemption if held till redemption, making them highly attractive to investors.  6. Geopolitical issues and high deficits are driving up gold prices, making cheap borrowing through SGBs difficult.  7. Despite urging citizens to avoid gold, the RBI buys 40 tonnes annually, revealing policy contradictions.  8.

Customers can choose to send the motorcycle separately or travel with it. The process is straightforward, requiring just four steps:  1. **Submit Documents**    - Take your motorcycle to the station's parcel service area and submit the necessary documents:      - Registration book or a copy of the vehicle's registration (If you are not the owner, provide the owner's identification.)      - Your ID card      - Contact details of the recipient, including name, phone number, address, and destination station  2. **Service Fee Calculation**    - The staff will calculate the service fee, including a handling charge and the transport cost.   3. **Wrap the Motorcycle**    - Protect your motorcycle by wrapping it securely with bubble wrap to prevent damage during transport. You can either do this yourself or ask the staff for assistance.  4. **Collect the Motorcycle**    - Upon arrival at the destination station, if you traveled with the motorcycle, present the ""Motorcycle Receipt"" provided at the origin station to collect your vehicle. If someone else is collecting it, they must be the designated recipient and present the receipt, which can be shown as a photograph. The station offers motorcycle storage for up to two days if immediate collection is not possible.  For more information, contact the SRT Customer Service Center at 1690, available 24/7, or visit the State Railway of Thailand's official Facebook page.  Source: @PR_SRT"

This funding, part of a broader donor-supported initiative, comes through a formula that has been a point of contention between Puntland and the FGS for years.  Historically, Puntland has rejected these budget support funds, arguing that the allocation formula agreed upon by the FGS and other Federal Member States (FMS) is fundamentally unfair. This stance led to the suspension of various development projects in Puntland, as the region sought direct support that bypassed the FGS mechanisms. Puntland's refusal to engage with the intergovernmental processes and its outright rejection of the budget allocation formula created a significant impasse, affecting not only budget support but also the broader intergovernmental relations.  ùóßùóµùó≤ ùóîùóπùóπùóºùó∞ùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùóôùóºùóøùó∫ùòÇùóπùóÆ  The current formula used for distributing donor budget support between the FMS, after the FGS takes its 60% share, allocates the remaining 40% among the states as follows::  1. Equal Share- 57% of the total budget support is divided equally among all the FMS. This is meant to ensure a base level of support to each state, regardless of their economic performance or governance.  2. Revenue Enhancement (Performance-Based) - 15% of the support is allocated based on each state's efforts to enhance its revenue collection. This performance-based component rewards states that have taken significant steps to improve their financial self-sufficiency.  3. Expenditure Management (Performance-Based) - Another 15% is distributed based on the effectiveness of each state's expenditure management. This incentivizes efficient and transparent use of funds.  4. Audit & Reporting (Performance-Based) - 10% of the support is tied to the state's audit and reporting standards. States that maintain rigorous financial oversight and transparency are rewarded under this criterion.  5. Fiscal Gap Equalization - The remaining 3% is allocated to address disparities in fiscal capacity among the states, helping to equalize opportunities for development.  While other FMS agreed to this formula, Puntland has consistently argued that it disadvantages the region, leading to its previous refusals.  A suprising Turn of Events  In a surprising move, Puntland recently requested the transfer of budget support funds according to the very formula it had long rejected. This U-turn has sparked widespread debate within and beyond the state. Observers are questioning whether this acceptance signals a shift in Puntland's broader policy stance, and whether this might open the door for the resumption of other development projects that have been on hold.  The decision raises critical questions: Has the Puntland administration now accepted the allocation formula it previously deemed unjust? If so, will this lead to a broader thawing of relations with the FGS, allowing other suspended development projects to move forward in the region?  The implications of this development are significant, leaving many confused about what stances are truly representative of Puntland's official position and what may be driven by personal agendas. The debate over the allocation formula has been a major issue, overshadowing the discussions on the suspended projects. This formula is not just a financial mechanism but a cornerstone for resource sharing between the central government and the FMS, making it a critical point of contention.  Opposition leaders argue that the dispute between the FGS and FMS is more about personal interests than state principles. They suggest that the Puntland president's acceptance of the transfer indicates that personal motivations, rather than a consistent state policy, may be influencing these decisions. #Puntland #Somalia"

2024-08-19 15:08:00+00:00,"PUNTLAND CONFIRMS RECEIPT OF WORLD BANK BUDGET SUPPORT FUNDS BUT DENIES IT WAS DEPOSITED IN PRESIDENT DENI'S PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT   In a long accusatory press conference earlier today against Villa Somalia and MP A. Xaange, Puntland Minister of Information Mr. Mohamoud Aydid Dirir responded to yesterday's Facebook post by Somalia's Deputy Minister of Finance Mr. Abdiqafar Xaange @A_Haange, in which the Deputy Minister listed over $6 million USD in budgetary support the Federal Government transfered to Puntland Treasury.   The FGS Deputy Finance Minister, who is also an MP representing the Mudug region of Puntland, accused President Deni of accepting Budget Support funds, in cash, from the Federal Government of Somalia while blocking millions of dollars of Puntland development funds.  Minister Aydid responding to Minister Xaange confirmed that Puntland did indeed receive $6 million budget support from the World Bank. ""Puntland had rights to these funds and following the proper procedures, Puntland submitted required documents and requested the budgetary support funds from the World Bank be transferred to a designated Puntland Ministry of Finance bank account.""  Minister Aydid Dirir added that @TheVillaSomalia tried to block these funds, but the World Bank intervened and ordered that funds be immediately transferred to the designated beneficiary, the Puntland State of Somalia.   On the rumor of funds being transferred directly to a designated personal account of President @HESaidADeni, Minister Aydid called it baseless, and added, ""World Bank funds can't be transferred to a personal bank account.""  Other than the World Bank budget support, Minister Aided also repeatedly denied receiving $6 million directly from the Federal Government.   On the issue of the Office of President Deni few days ago requiring all humanitarian and development projects and programs (https://x.com/radiodaljir/status/1825249302853329405?t=Chv8S-yOxtFT4ihYfoJaHQ&s=19) go through the Office of the President, Radio Daljir asked the Minister if the intention behind this requirement, as accused of the Office by some Puntland contractors, is to deny certain contractors deemed ""politically undesirable"" from implementing development and humanitarian projects and programs in Puntland.   Minister Dirir denied these accusations and said Puntland has the proper procedures and agencies in place to manage humanitarian and development projects and there are no contract brokers at the Office of the President who seeks monetary gains from such projects and programs.  > Daljir Media"

2024-08-19 15:30:00+00:00,"We bring to the attention of TN CM Thiru @mkstalin the following: Chennai, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai, Palakkad, Salem, and Thiruvananthapuram - these are divisions under Southern Railway; not every division falls under TN.   The budget for doubling works for Southern Railways could be reduced, but the TN-specific projects for doubling works have received an increased allocation of ‚Çπ1696 Crore in the revised project. The interim budget allocation for TN-specific projects for doubling works was ‚Çπ1437 Crores. There is an increase in allocation of ‚Çπ259 Crores.   Notably, the budget for gauge conversion has seen a net increase of 65 Crores for TN-specific projects under Southern Railways. Tiruchchirappalli-Nagore-Karaikal gauge conversion work in TN has received an increased allocation of ‚Çπ135 Crore.   The overall budget for Southern Railways for Track Renewals (which includes track repair, replacement, and maintenance works) has increased to ‚Çπ1755 Crores from ‚Çπ1240 Crores. Most of these Track Renewal projects are allocated to divisions under Southern Railways in Tamil Nadu, ensuring the safety and reliability of our railway network.    While the budgeting for New Lines has been reduced for divisions in TN under Southern Railway, there has been a substantial increase in allocation for Doubling works, Gauge Conversion, and Track Renewals.   However, we seek the following clarification from TN CM Thiru @mkstalin:   - For the Madurai-Tuticorin via Aruppukkottai (143.5 km) New Line, approximately 870.98 Ha. of Land is required, and as of December 2023, only 74.87 Ha of land was acquired. We understand that the budget for the new line is allocated based on the progress made on land acquisition. Can the TN Govt clarify the status of land acquisition?   - Land acquisition for a new line between Tindivanam and Tiruvannamalai has been ongoing since 2010. Has the Land acquisition been completed?  A similar question arises for other new railway lines where the budgets are cut, and the DMK Government is duty-bound to answer.   The average annual budget outlay to TN was just ‚Çπ879 crore per year during 2009-14 during the DMK Congress Regime. However, allocations to TN in all streams have increased significantly over the last ten years, and this year's railway budget of ‚Çπ6362 Crore to TN stands as a testament to this."

The assessment was based on a mismatch between the company's GSTR-2A and GSTR-9 returns. ‚ñ™The assessee contended that the assessment order was passed without proper reasoning, as the taxpayer's reply was simply extracted in the order without any explanation or justification for confirming the tax proposal.  Court Judgement ‚ñ™ Observations: The Madras High Court observed that the assessment order lacked proper reasoning, noting that the taxpayer's reply was mentioned but not addressed with any specific reasons. ‚ñ™ Judgment: The Court set aside the assessment order due to the lack of reasoning and directed that the attachment on Ford India's bank account be lifted. ‚ñ™ Outcome: The matter was remanded back to the Deputy Commissioner for reconsideration, with instructions to provide Ford India with a reasonable opportunity for a hearing before making any further¬†decisions."

Taxation Issues:    - Exporters are currently subject to a 2% advance tax, while businesses in the same field with domestic sales are paying  1.25%.  7. EDS (0.25%):    - It should be held in abeyance until the surcharge already collected is spent on export development.  8. Sindh Government:    - Charging 1.8% on imports under EFS, which are temporary imports for re-export. These imports should be exempt from taxes, duties, and levies as they are meant for value addition.  9. Punjab Government:    - Charging a 0.20% stamp duty on export-related bills of exchange, a practice not followed by any other province.

2024-08-20 16:36:00+00:00,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued a clarification addressing recent misinformation regarding the need for an income-tax clearance certificate (ITCC) for Indian citizens travelling abroad. Contrary to recent reports, all Indian citizens don't need to obtain an ITCC before leaving the country.  This section, originally enacted through the Finance Act, of 2003, pertains to the circumstances under which a tax clearance certificate must be obtained by persons domiciled in India. The recent amendment merely adds references to the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, ensuring that liabilities under this Act are treated similarly to those under the Income-tax Act.  CBDT highlighted that the requirement for an ITCC applies only in specific scenarios. As per the existing provisions and instructions, only individuals involved in serious financial irregularities or those with direct tax arrears exceeding Rs. 10 lakh (not stayed by any authority) need to obtain the ITCC. This regulation has been in place since 2003 and remains unchanged by the recent amendment.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) clarified that an ITCC is required only in specific cases:  Serious Financial Issues: If someone is involved in major financial problems and their presence is needed for investigations.  Large Unpaid Taxes: If a person owes more than Rs. 10 lakh in taxes that are not on hold by any authority.  The notification further added that the process to obtain an ITCC involves recording specific reasons and obtaining approval from the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income or Chief Commissioner of income tax."

And then I made a bomb that nobody would release! So the only movie I could possibly make was the sequel to the one that had a little success; so Evil Dead II kind of saved my life. It was the only movie I could make. And then in the case of Spider-Man, I set it up when we were working on the script with our writers to make sure that it had a continuation, so that the next director could pick up story threads. I didn't know I'd be directing it, but I'd set it up for a director with unresolved conflicts. I realized that I really liked the team and the crew, and I wanted to tell that story myself. So it's for different reasons that I make sequels, but it's worked out very well for me.""  (Sam Raimi, Emma Robertson, The Talks, 2022)"

Minister Farah tells Radio Daljir that ""irrespective of what has been exchanged over social media, I can without hesitation confirm to you that Puntland Ministry of Finance has received all budget support funds requested from the World Bank and was subsequently transferred through the Central Bank of Somalia and into Puntland Treasury. There is nothing in arrears. All funds have been billed, transferred, and received.""  On budget support funds often alleged by Puntland to be delayed by Somalia's Ministry of Finance, Radio Daljir has reached out to an anonymous high-ranking MP in the FGS Parliament and the MP responded, ""Budget support funds are in the Federal Budget passed by the Parliament, and no one, I repeat no one, has the ability to delay or deny those funds from Somalia's Federal Member States.""  > Daljir Media"

Does this mean that these unprocessed ITRs are likely to be picked for scrutiny? Probably not.   As per Ankit Jain ‚Äã""It's important to note that the selection of returns for scrutiny is handled independently by the tax authorities and is unrelated to the processing of tax returns. The processing stage primarily checks for mathematical accuracy and verifies claims for tax credits. Scrutiny notices are issued later when the tax authorities identify ITRs that require further examination or additional information""  As per Swapnil Patni ‚Äã""I would say, that while there is a slight chance, it's more likely that the delay is due to procedural reasons rather than scrutiny. There is a possibility, but it's not necessarily the case that all unprocessed ITRs are picked for scrutiny. If your ITR were selected for scrutiny, you would typically receive a notice or communication from the Income Tax Department outlining the reason and required actions. Additionally, it's important to note that even if your ITR is processed without any demand, it can still be selected for scrutiny later.""   ""While it's possible that a portion of the unprocessed ITRs may be flagged for scrutiny, this is unlikely to be the primary reason for the delay in processing of such a large percentage of filings,"" says Sandeep Agrawal  With inputs from Abhishek Soni  https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/26-itrs-yet-to-be-processed-after-22-days-of-the-deadline-will-your-itr-come-under-scrutiny/articleshow/112728081.cms"

2024-08-23 08:02:00+00:00,"CBDT forms committee to review I-T Act, 'sunset' clauses to be eliminated  An internal committee of the Income Tax Department will review the 1961 direct tax law to eliminate redundant clauses as well as adopt best global practices to simplify it for taxpayers for better compliance, CBDT chief Ravi Agrawal has said.  The panel, comprising income tax (IT) officials from across the country, has started working to identify areas of improvement in the Income Tax Act, 1961, he said and added that the exercise is being conducted under a central government-mandated comprehensive review of the law.  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Agrawal said the committee is looking at the best global practices that can be adopted as well as cutting redundancies in the existing law and finding those clauses that have reached their sunset, and hence, can be eliminated.  ""An internal committee of competent officers of the department from all across the country has been formed. They have started working to identify areas of improvement. This is a work in progress...,"" he told PTI on Wednesday during an event here to mark 165 years of income tax in India.  He said the committee is looking at the ""problem statement"" given to it in the recent Budget. It is trying to find the ""best way forward"" in giving the country a new direct tax law, Agrawal said.  During the event, the CBDT chief assured Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the work of reviewing the Act will be done within the stipulated time-frame of six months as announced by her in the Budget presented last month.  The minister, during the Wednesday event, asked the I-T department to use simple language in its notices and communications with taxpayers so that they are able to understand these quickly without getting intimidated.  Agrawal said this factor is also a part of the I-T law review. The committee is trying to make tax communication simple and easy to understand to encourage compliance of rules by taxpayers, he said. The Income Tax Act, 1961, started its journey in 1922. It contains 298 sections and 23 chapters and other provisions in its current form of 1961.  Sitharaman, while presenting the 2024-25 Union Budget, had announced a ""comprehensive"" review of the Income Tax Act.  The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and understand.  This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax certainty to the taxpayers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in litigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months, she had said.  Agrawal also said the CBDT will ""put more officers"" within the next 10-15 days to ""expeditiously"" clear the ""substantial"" number of appeals pending at the Income Tax Department level.

2024-08-23 12:26:00+00:00,"Rajasthan high court notices to Centre on new clause the Income Tax Act  In a writ petition filed by the Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan challenging the constitutional validity of a new clause under section 43B(h) of the Income Tax Act, a Rajasthan high court division bench comprising Justices Pankaj Bhandari and Praveer Bhatnagar has issued notices to the Centre and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).  The court has instructed the respondents to provide reasons why a stay should not be granted on the enforcement of this provision, which relates to payments made to micro and small enterprises (MSEs), for the duration of the petition's pendency. Next hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept 20.  The petitioners contended that the Act's section 43B(h) places significant financial burden on businesses, especially those in export sector, as it imposes strict payment timelines for buyers, while export payments often take longer to process. Moreover, there is already a penalty in the form of high interest payments on delayed payments and disallowance of such interest in computing income. ""Therefore, treating purchase price as income would be highly arbitrary and discretionary,"" the petitioner contended."
