2022-07-20 04:20:00+00:00,5. Why should not the poorer consumers aspire to buy pre-packaged and labeled goods?   6. The Modi Government is penalising aspiration and a desire to buy more hygienically packed goods  7. Go through the list. The GST on crematoriums has been increased to 18%!
2022-07-20 04:20:00+00:00,8. Assume there are some input taxes in pre-packaged goods. Was there a demand from producers and sellers to impose a GST on pre-packaged and labeled goods? Not to our knowledge.
