However there were two issues I see. a very few places has been occupied by shops and the option to cross the mount road GST junction near the le royal meridian is not designed right.  I did not check the other side at the Alandur side.  Even though there is option for the two wheelers and four wheelers to cross the road from the meridian side and enter the subway below the kathipara, there is no proper signal. A signal would be helpful. Atleast pedestrian push button based signal will be good.   The real questions is how much do Chennai walk today. I myself have used to using bikes for a 500m distance for house hold purchase.    If I hadnot walked today, I would have hired a auto or took my vehicle to make this trip. This will increase my road presence adding to the existing traffic.   If a 10 people started waling for a 1 KM distance, we can remove one share auto from the road.  If 100 people started walking we could definitely remove one bus from the road.   Think of the cumulative effect of such a mass movement. This will help us with a better health and at the same time make Chennai more sustainable.   #walkchallenge #chennaiwalks #chennai #Chennaiwalkchallenge #1KMChallenge #Sustainability"

Toyota & VW are global leaders in the sales & profits but Toyota is far ahead in having the trust of a common man in their products in Developed & Developing Nations because of the reliability, Engine specs & ownership experience.  VW Group on the other hand lives in their own supremacy bubble in developing Nations as if they are doing a favour by having their cars here. Yes they are trying to shed the old baggage but a portfolio with 5-7 cars under 60 lacs is must after proper research of the market and pitch products at the same cost in the competition or build them up specifically from the ground for budget markets.

The same should apply to agricultural income. Lower income should be subject to minimal tax. It's the higher concentrated income that's the problem. I am sure you will agree that there are some land owners who make significant income from agricultural land despite these costs and challenges. Can't paint everyone with the same brush."

2023-08-05 02:25:00+00:00,"Title: The Grit and Grace: A Startup Founder's Daily Battle for Survival  As a startup founder, life is far from the plush comforts of the corporate world. While our corporate counterparts enjoy the luxury of stable salaries, hefty marketing budgets, and grand offices, we face a different reality. Each day is a relentless pursuit to keep our company afloat, navigating through a sea of challenges that threaten to sink our ship.  Unlike the corporate world, where resources seem abundant, we must carefully manage every penny. Thoughts of monthly salaries for our dedicated staff, their families relying on us, and ensuring bills are paid on time weigh heavily on our minds. The responsibility we carry is immense, but it's a burden we willingly shoulder for the sake of our startup's success.  From paying office space rents to electricity and water bills, every financial obligation rests on our shoulders. Loans we've taken to fuel growth and vendor partnerships that help us thrive all demand attention. And if we have secured government grants, the paperwork and wait for disbursement add another layer of pressure.  Government grants, though vital for growth, often come with a complex claiming process. We need to use our company's funds first, making sure every document is in order, and then await the disbursal that can take ages. The bureaucratic hurdles can be daunting, and we sometimes wonder if we will ever receive the support we so desperately need.  Yet, as the founder, we wear a brave face, shielding our team from the burden we carry. We must remain composed and lead with determination, reassuring our staff that we are in control. Sleepless nights become a norm as we ponder over strategies to secure the monthly payroll and keep the ship steady in turbulent waters.  But amidst the storm, we find strength in our team, the united force propelling our startup forward. Our staff might not always see the sleepless nights or feel the pressure we endure, but they witness our dedication and commitment to their wellbeing and the company's survival.  In this rollercoaster journey, we know that every storm eventually calms. The relentless efforts and sleepless nights are not in vain. The day will come when we can celebrate together, basking in the triumph of surviving the toughest challenges. It's moments like these that make the entrepreneurial journey so rewarding.  Through the grit and grace of a startup founder's daily battle, we learn to find resilience, adaptability, and a spirit of camaraderie that unites us with our team. It's not just about surviving; it's about thriving in the face of adversity and celebrating the triumphs that come our way.  So, to all startup founders, take heart and remember that every storm will pass. Your unwavering determination and courage are steering your ship towards calmer waters. The journey may be challenging, but the rewards are worth every sleepless night and every ounce of pressure you endure. Together, we will weather the storms and emerge stronger, celebrating the sweet taste of success as one united force."

It relies much more on fees/taxes, and customs, which make up more than 85% of its income.  The UAE federal gov does depend on oil for about half of its income but that reliance has been decreasing over the years as the state diversifies its investments and grows its non-oil sectors.  Back on Dubai, the below is an estimate breakdown of its income which is estimated to be $15.65 Bn  Gov fees: 57% (hotel stays, municipal fees, business licenses, fines, tolls, etc) VAT: 20% (We have a 5% VAT in the UAE) Customs: 10%  Oil revenue: 6% Gov investment returns: 6% Tax on foreign banks: 1%  The reason we have a better standard of living than most is that the city spends heavily on its infrastructure .. roads, hospitals, schools, luxury housing projects, bridges, solar plants,.. without mentioning constant law overhauls to add or change anything that isn't necessary or makes no sense anymore, or the ease of accessing government services   We're not a perfect city obviously and we have problems such as the heat, road congestions, and high prices in certain areas.. but its pretty difficult to live elsewhere once you're used to life here"

Financial Preparedness:  Prioritize a robust financial plan, ensuring you're financially ready to invest, including having a stable credit score, a clear budget, and understanding your borrowing capacity. This readiness sets the foundation for a secure investment journey.  Market Research and Due Diligence:  Conduct extensive market research and due diligence on the property, location, and surrounding area. Assess market trends, property values, growth potential, and neighborhood dynamics to make an informed investment decision.  Risk Mitigation:  Identify and mitigate potential risks associated with the investment. Plan for contingencies, evaluate market volatility, assess property condition thoroughly, and understand the legal aspects involved to minimize risks.  Long-Term Investment Strategy:  Develop a clear long-term investment strategy aligned with your goals. Consider whether you aim for rental income, property appreciation, or a mix of both, and plan accordingly to achieve your objectives.  Professional Guidance and Networking:  Seek guidance from real estate professionals, such as realtors, financial advisors, and legal experts.
